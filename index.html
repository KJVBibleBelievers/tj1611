<b><h3>God's simple plan of salvation:</h3></b>

Did you know that there is a penalty for sin? That’s right, just as man demands punishment for crime, God demands a punishment for sin. The Bible says: “For the wages of sin is death…” Rom. 6:23 “And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.” Rev. 20:14,15<br>

But God, in his mercy and through his grace, gave his son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross to pay the penalty for us. He now offers Salvation from hell as a free gift, without any works on our part, to anyone who will accept it. In order to accept this gift, you must:<br>

<b>Admit that you are a sinner:</b> “For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.” Rom. 3:23 “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:” Rom. 5:12 “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.” Rom. 3:10<br>

<b>Believe that Jesus Christ Died for your sin:</b> “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” Rom. 5:8 “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners;…” I Tim. 1:15 “For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” I Cor. 15: 3,4<br>

<b>Receive Jesus Christ as your personal Savior:</b> “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:” John 1:12 “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Rom. 10:13<br>

Whosoever includes you. Shall be saved means not maybe, nor can, but shall be saved. Right now, if you’ve never accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, and you would like to, simply go to God in prayer. If you’re not sure how to pray, you might pray something like this:<br>

<i>"Dear God, I know that I am a sinner. I believe that Jesus Christ was my substitute when he died on the cross. I believe that his shed blood, death, burial, and resurrection were for me. I now receive him as my Saviour. Thank you for the forgiveness of my sins, the gift of salvation, and everlasting life, because of your grace. In Jesus’ name I pray, Amen."</i><br>

These are not some magical words that you repeat to get to heaven, they’re just an example of what you might pray to God if you honestly believe it and want to be saved.<br>
